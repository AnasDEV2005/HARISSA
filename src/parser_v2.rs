// other parser is a mess and a headache
// i wanna redo a somewhat clean version
//

1. the iterator becomes independant from the parser object
2. RAAAH NEVER MIND using a struct for this is utterly stupid
3. just more borrow checker headache for no reason what the heck bro
4. never let chatgpt cook again
